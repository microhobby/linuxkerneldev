# Embedded Linux Dev

Tool to help find documentation and device tree matching on device driver source
code, by device tree binding compatible strings.

## Requirements

The extension works on Linux systems, also tested on WSL, and uses some 
packages for its correct operation. Before use you must install the following 
dependencies on your system:

- bash
- universal-ctags

An important detail is to install universal-ctags and not exuberant-ctags.
Because exuberant does not index device tree files.

For a complete development experience for the Linux kernel development, during
the installation of the extension, the following extensions will be required to
be installed together:

- [DeviceTree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=plorefice.devicetree) (syntax highlighting for device-tree .dts e .dtsi files)
- [kconfig](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=luveti.kconfig) (syntax highlighting for Kconfig files)

## Features

All features of the extension can be accessed by clicking commands through the
activity bar:

In the next topics, I will describe each of the extension features.

### Device Tree Doc From Compatible

In a device-tree file, ".dts" or ".dtsi", or in a device driver file ".c", mouse
click on a "compatible" string and select the command. VS Code will open the
corresponding documentation file for the compatible:

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

### Device Driver From Compatible

In a device-tree file, ".dts" or ".dtsi", mouse click on a "compatible" string
and select the command. VS Code will match and open the code file, “.c”, from
the driver that implements compatible:

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

### ARM/ARM64 dts/dtsi From Include

In a device-tree file, “.dts” or “.dtsi”, mouse click on the string of a
device-tree include and select the command. VS Code will open the corresponding
file:

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

There are two options for this command, one for ARM and other for ARM64, because
the devices-tree files for each of these archs are on different paths.

### Linux Include From Selected

In ".c", ".dts" or ".dtsi" file, mouse click on an include string and select the
command. VS Code will open the corresponding include:

This functionality can also be selected from the right click context menu:

### Generate CTags

Last but not least. This functionality generates a “.vscode-ctags” file in the
root folder that has been opened. This file is the tag index generated by
universal-ctags. This file is required to generate the project code navigation:

- Jump to definition:

- Code completion:

- Mouse hover tags:

The work here was only possible because of the [Exuberant CTags](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=chriswheeldon.exuberant-ctags) extension, which
I used as a base. Thanks Chris Wheeldon.
